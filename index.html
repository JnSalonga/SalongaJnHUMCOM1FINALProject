	<div id="why"><h3>Why UC?</h3><p>On June 10, 2010, the University of the Cordilleras was conferred the "Autonomus Status" by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), after being issued the "Award of Distinction" certificate by the CHED Chairman himself, 
Emmanuel Y. Angeles. The certificate cited UC's exemplary performance in the trilogy functions of higher education, namely: instruction, research in public service, and in recognition of the outstanding performance of its graduates; which manifest
 UC's genuine commitment to quality excellence and global competitiveness.

This distinction came after UC's assessment and affirmation of quality standards through CHED's "Institutional Quality Assurance through Monitoring and Evaluation (IQuAME)" during a visit by CHED's respected panels of experts and assessors from 
different institutions and regions on May 16, 2010. The 3-day visit, highlighted with interviews and ocular inspection, provided for the panel, evidences of substantive and significant adherence to the following quality assurance areas: Governance 
and Management, Quality of Teaching and Research, Support for Students, Relations with the Community, and Management of Resources. Whereupon, the CHED Commissioners, in an en banc session in May 26, 2010, certified and approved the panel's final 
report recommendation, that UC have complied with all quality standards corresponding to "Category A(teaching)", or as a "Teaching University". UC is so far the only Higher Educational Institution in the Cordillera Administration Region (CAR) to 
achieve this highest level of categorization through an institutional accreditation. This certification and the awarding of Autonomous Status is a manifestation of UC's policy to deliberately seek external scrutiny, as an engine for assuring continuous 
institutional self-improvement.</center></div>
